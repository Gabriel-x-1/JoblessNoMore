## Description

**JoblessNoMore** is a web application that revolutionizes the job-seeking process by bringing the swipe-based approach to recruitment. The app connects employees (job seekers) with organizations looking to hire, allowing them to swipe through each other’s profiles to create matches. Employees can browse through companies and apply for positions, while organizations can swipe through the employees who have applied to their listings. When both swipe right, a match is made, and the employee is notified by email. Organizations can then view their matches and contact potential candidates.

## Features

- **Swipe Matching**: Employees can browse organizations and apply for jobs. Organizations can swipe only through employees who have applied to their job listings. If both swipe right, a match is made.
- **Email Notifications**: When a match is made, employees receive an instant email notification, keeping them engaged with the recruitment process.
- **Match Dashboard for Organizations**: Organizations have a dashboard where they can view all of their matches, including profiles of employees who have applied and are interested in the organization.
- **Employee Profiles**: Employees can create profiles showcasing their skills, experiences, and job preferences, increasing their visibility to potential employers.
- **Job Applications**: Employees can apply to various companies and wait to see if their profile gets matched.
